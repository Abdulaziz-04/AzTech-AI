# Projects

## Projects
This section showcases a curated selection of my personal engineering projects, freelance client builds and research work. These projects span full-stack software engineering, cloud deployments, machine learning, agentic systems, interactive applications, and academic innovation, illustrating both breadth and depth across modern computing disciplines.

- Category: Web & Software Engineering
### Full-stack engineering, architecture & real-world software systems
Full-stack software builds covering system architecture, UI engineering, real-time networking, and production-ready application design. Includes both personal and client-delivered projects.

- Category: Machine Learning, AI & Computer Vision
### Applied ML, vision systems, AR pipelines & LLM fine-tuning
Applied ML,CV and Augemnted Reality projects, medical imaging, intelligent agents, and fine-tuned language models built with practical training, evaluation, and inference workflows.

-Category: Research & Experimental Systems
### Published research projects: VR Humanoid Agents & statistical modeling

Published research projects exploring LLM-based humanoid agents in VR environments and statistical modeling to identify hiring biases in academic TA recruitement.

- Category: Backend, Systems & Distributed Computing
### Infrastructure, distributed logic, compilers & microservices
Core systems work including compilers, blockchain primitives, microservices, indexing engines, and distributed logic. These projects emphasize correctness, scalability, and strong fundamentals.

- Category: Interactive Applications, Games & AI-Driven Prototypes
### Human-Computer Interaction Systems, Real-Time Chat, and Game Prototypes
Prototypes for real-time interactions with cross-platform development, HCI and gameplay systems. Includes student chat application, emotion-driven interfaces, and interactive games across web and desktop.

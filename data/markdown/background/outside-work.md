## Outside of Work
- Chess and strategy games sharpen my pattern recognition and fast decision making as I enjoy testing how well I can think ahead under pressure, especially when playing my favorite game, Age of Empires.

- I am a steady reader of psychology, cognitive science, and technical blogs and books like Thinking Fast and Slow have influenced how I frame product and engineering tradeoffs.

- I enjoy creative tinkering through small game prototypes, music exploration, and interactive experiments which helps keep my curiosity and problem solving fresh.

- I love exploring new places and ideas through hiking, travel, and learning languages such as Arabic and Spanish to better connect with diverse people.

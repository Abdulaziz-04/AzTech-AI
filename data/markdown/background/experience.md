# Experience

## Work Experience

### Intel Corporation - Software Engineer, Data Science Org.
- Timeline: Jun 2024 - Jul 2025

- Highlights:

- Led the conversion of legacy .NET wafer analysis workflows to Python, leveraging Python-Net and subprocess integration to reuse 40+ existing DLL libraries, saving 80+ hours of development time while enabling seamless execution of .NET code in python environment.

- Engineered low-code data visualization modules on the GENIE platform using Django, Angular, and Docker, generating JSON-based chart configurations automatically via dataclasses, improving visualization efficiency by 35% over manual methods for wafer and engineering analytics.

- Deployed a containerized LLM-RAG microservice on AWS ECS to standardize 600+ excursion reports, integrating OpenAI embeddings, LangChain and FastAPI, cutting root cause analysis time by 75% and saving approximately $100,000 annually in labor costs.

- Built CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions, integrating Xunit and Jest for testing and Prometheus/Grafana for monitoring, which reduced wafer analysis reporting latency by 60% and improved dashboard reliability. Used Apache Spark and Docker to automate ML pipeline orchestration, reducing model update time from 2 hours to under 30 mins.

### Northeastern University - Research Assistant
- Timeline: Jan 2024 - May 2024

- Published a paper at SIGCSE 2025 titled "Student Application Trends for Teaching Assistant Positions"

- Highlights

- Analyzed 15,000+ TA applications using Jensen-Shannon Distance, t-tests, and ANOVA to identify hiring biases in STEM programs

- Built interactive dashboards to visualize demographic trends; revealed 42.5% bias for female MS applicants in entry-level TA roles.

- Findings led to equity-focused hiring recommendations adopted by academic leadership for 2025 cycle policy changes

### Northeastern University - Research Apprentice
- Timeline: Sep 2023 - Dec 2023

- Awarded the Khoury Research Apprenticeship awarded with a tuition waiver for 8000$. Published a paper at CHI 2024 titled

"Building LLM-based AI agents in Social Virtual Reality"
- Highlights

- Directed a team of 4 to develop LLM-driven agents in VRChat (social platform) with CUDA-optimized inference, achieving sub 3s latency.

- Built a multi-threaded dialogue engine with OpenAI API, MongoDB, and custom retrieval algorithm in Python, improving user immersion by 30% based on longer session duration and higher platform usage.

- Integrated Whisper & Vosk APIs for text-to-speech mapping; achieved 95% MAP accuracy, validated using LLaMA-7B and human ratings.

### Intel Corporation - Software Developer Intern
- Timeline: Jun 2023 - Sep 2023
- Highlights

- Established a GitHub-style change tracking system for non-technical teams with React.js, Node.js, and SQL.

- Deployed it on IIS server to provide file-level tracking, admin controls, and role-based authorization, saving 15 engineer-hours per week by improving operational transparency.

- Enhanced backend reliability by implementing Jest and Cypress tests, achieving 98% code coverage, reducing integration bugs, and ensuring application performance.

- Optimized SQL query pipelines for multi-factory wafer data using multi-threading and batch processing, reducing data processing time from 2500 seconds to 1200 seconds, ensuring faster downstream analysis and timely reporting.

### Softmax AI - Machine Learning Engineer (Contract)
- Timeline: Jan 2022 - Jun 2022
- Highlights

- Built home decor tile visualizer using UNet segmentation and depth estimation in PyTorch; reduced backend image rendering time to 30 seconds.

- Deployed full-stack React-Flask app on AWS with Nginx, increasing client product engagement during demos by 25% across 3 teams.

- Built a sentiment classifier using SVM on 1,200 drug reviews; improved F1-score from 52% to 85% using SMOTE and text preprocessing.

- Forecasted 10-min NSE stock movement using LSTM on 90 selected features out of 300 features, achieving 78% F1-score and reducing model size by 70%.

- Tuned hyperparameters using GridSearchCV, optimizing classification and sequence models for precision, recall, and stability

### Hexaware Technologies - Software Developer
- Timeline: Jan 2021 - Aug 2022
- Highlights

- Developed a full-stack healthcare claims platform using React.js, Node.js, and Express, enabling patients and providers to track claim history, manage billing, and access Explanation of Benefits (EOBs), supporting over 12,000 daily active users across multiple hospitals.

- Designed and implemented Spring Boot microservices with Hibernate ORM for claims processing, provider search, and benefit verification workflows, handling 800k claims annually and ensuring reliable and scalable back-end operations.

- Devised secure, responsive React dashboards for administrators to monitor claim workflows, provider activity, and patient billing trends, tracking 30,000+ claim records monthly and enabling actionable operational insights.

- Implemented Apache Kafka and Redis caching for real-time claim event streaming and query acceleration, supporting 20,000+ events per hour and improving system responsiveness for patient and provider operations.

- Streamlined deployment and infrastructure provisioning using Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, and Docker, ensuring HIPAA-compliant storage of medical documents in S3 buckets with server-side encryption, reducing manual deployment time per release by 60 hours monthly.

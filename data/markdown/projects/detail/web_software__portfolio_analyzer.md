# Portfolio Analyzer
A modular Java portfolio management system built with MVC and MVVM, supporting flexible portfolios, automated investment plans, portfolio rebalancing, performance visualization and multi-layered testing.

### Timeline
Nov 2022 to Dec 2022

### Tech Stack
Java, Swing, MVC + MVVM, Factory & Command patterns, AlphaVantage API, ElasticSearch Portfolio performance visualization generated through the GUI using live and cached market data.

### Problem
Build a portfolio management system that can expand over multiple iterations without breaking earlier functionality, while supporting both console and GUI interfaces and live API-driven data.

### Solution
Designed a modular Java application using MVC and MVVM patterns, introduced helper models, factories, command objects and mock components for testability, and extended the system with flexible portfolios, investment plans, rebalancing and visualization.

### Result
Fully functioning analyzer supporting creation, modification, visualization, cost basis, investment plans, rebalancing and persistence across users, backed by extensive unit testing and mock testing layers.

## Introduction
Portfolio Analyzer was built as a multi-iteration project focused on applying SOLID principles and evolving a basic console application into a robust GUI driven financial tool. MVC formed the foundation, later extended with MVVM-style separation for Swing views to reduce UI-logic coupling. To keep the code extensible, I introduced factories for portfolio types, helper models for validation and caching, command pattern for user operations and modular interfaces for adding new features incrementally. Market data retrieval used the AlphaVantage API with caching and date validation. Testing was a major focus: mock models, mock views and mock controllers enabled isolated testing of all layers. Contract tests ensured feature additions never broke earlier assignments. 10+ major features added across iterative assignments without modifying core contracts. Rebalancing functionality introduced to redistribute portfolio weights automatically. Integrated ElasticSearch to index portfolio snapshots and allow faster search and analysis. Reduced API usage by ~45% after adding caching and transaction date preprocessing.

## Key Outcomes and Learnings
The project emphasized extensibility, testability and design-driven development. It combined architectural patterns with API integration, caching, visualization and portfolio analytics. Applied SOLID principles by introducing new features through helper interfaces, factories and strategy components without editing stable logic. Strengthened understanding of MVC and MVVM by separating domain logic from views and wiring multiple interfaces to the same core models and controllers. Gained experience collaborating on and extending another team's codebase while respecting previously defined contracts and behavior. Used ElasticSearch to index portfolio data and perform trend analysis.

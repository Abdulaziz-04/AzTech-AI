# Collaborative Painter - Project Detail
Web and Software

# Collaborative Painter
A real time collaborative drawing platform built in DLang using SDL and UDP networking. Multiple users can paint, chat, and share a dynamic canvas together with synchronized updates across all connected clients.

### Timeline
Feb 2023 to Apr 2023

### Tech Stack
DLang, SDL, gtkD, UDP via WebSockets, unit-threaded testing Collaborative drawing demonstration showing multiple clients interacting in real time on a shared canvas.

## Quick Insights

### Problem
The client needed a fast desktop tool that allowed multiple users to collaboratively paint on a shared canvas while staying synchronized and communicating in real time.

### Solution
A DLang based collaborative painter using SDL and gtkD for rendering and UI, with UDP networking to broadcast drawing commands and chat updates efficiently across clients.

### Result
Fully working prototype supporting 10 concurrent users, real time synchronization, integrated chat, and unit tested core features for drawing and networking.

## Introduction
This project was developed as part of the Foundations of Software Engineering course at Northeastern University. Our team of 4 people designed and implemented a desktop application that enables users to collaboratively paint on a shared canvas while communicating in real time through an integrated chat panel. The client requested a high performance, portable, low latency collaborative system. DLang was chosen due to its performance and memory safety benefits, along with its use in large scale systems such as Facebook infrastructure tools. SDL and gtkD enabled rendering and UI development, while UDP allowed lightweight real time message broadcasting. Core features were unit tested using unit threaded testing to ensure stability. 10/10 milestones completed successfully. Completed over 6 weeks as part of an agile milestone driven project. Supports 10 concurrent users with synchronized real time drawing. Flood fill with line scanning improved fill speed by 35%.

## Demonstration
Real time chat feature that allows users to communicate without leaving the canvas. GitHub Project board used for planning, milestone tracking and team task distribution.

## Key Outcomes and Learnings
This project demonstrated distributed system design, low latency networking and event driven programming. It also required strong team coordination, sprint based planning and the adoption of new languages and tools aligned with client constraints. Learned how to architect a collaborative real time application using UDP message passing. Strengthened team collaboration through milestones, shared ownership and structured agile workflow. Built experience with DLang, SDL rendering, gtkD UI development and performance optimization for drawing tools. Developed unit tested components for networking and rendering to prevent regressions during feature expansion.

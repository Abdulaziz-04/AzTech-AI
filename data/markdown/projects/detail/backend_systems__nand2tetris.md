# From Nand to Tetris: Building a Computer and Compiler from Scratch
Backend & Distributed Logic Two-part systems project where I built a full 16-bit computer, assembler, virtual machine, and compiler from primitive NAND gates. The stack ends in a high-level programming language called Jack that runs on the hardware I designed using an emulator. I completed all projects for both Coursera courses "Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: Part 1 and Part 2" , submitted every assignment, scored 98% overall, and earned both certifications.

### Tech Stack
Hardware Description Language (HDL), Hack assembly, Java, shell tooling, hardware and VM emulators The full stack I implemented: from a single NAND gate to logic chips, CPU, assembler, VM, and Jack compiler running user programs.

## Quick insights

### Goal
Design a full computer system from the logic-gate level and build a usable high-level programming language called Jack with it's own compiler and toolchain that runs games and apps on that hardware.

### Scope
Implemented over 30+ hardware chips in HDL, a 16-bit Hack CPU and memory system , a two-stage software stack (assembler and VM translator), and a multi-pass Jack compiler.

### Outcome
The final system runs full Jack programs such as Tetris and a simple operating system (arrays, math library, memory manager), compiled by my Java tools from Jack to machine language that executes on the hardware I built (via emulation).

## Hardware platform: from NAND to a 16-bit computer
Part 1 focused on creating the hardware stack using the course HDL. Starting from a single NAND primitive, I implemented combinational and sequential chips and composed them into a usable computer.

### Core logic
Built gates such as NOT, AND, OR, MUX, and adders, then composed them into an ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) supporting arithmetic, bitwise operations, and zero/negative flags.

### Stateful components
Implemented Register, RAM8/64/4K/16K, counters, and a screen-mapped memory unit using flip-flops and clocked logic.

### CPU and computer
Wired the ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit), registers, and instruction decoder into a Hack CPU supporting A-instruction and C-instruction i.e. Address and Compute instructions plus conditional jumps, then added ROM and memory to form the complete computer chip.

### Example: ALU snippet and behavior
The ALU combines configurable input negation, zeroing, and function selection. Here is a simplified HDL excerpt (names adjusted for

### brevity)
// Simplified ALU style HDL CHIP ALU { IN  x[16], y[16], zx, nx, zy, ny, f, no; OUT out[16], zr, ng;

### PARTS
Mux16(a=x, b=false, sel=zx, out=xz); Not16(in=xz, out=xn); Mux16(a=xz, b=xn, sel=nx, out=x1); Mux16(a=y, b=false, sel=zy, out=yz); Not16(in=yz, out=yn); Mux16(a=yz, b=yn, sel=ny, out=y1); Add16(a=x1, b=y1, out=sum); And16(a=x1, b=y1, out=andv); Mux16(a=andv, b=sum, sel=f, out=out0); Not16(in=out0, out=out1); Mux16(a=out0, b=out1, sel=no, out=out); Or16Way(in=out, out=any); Not(in=any, out=zr); And(in=out[15], in2=true, out=ng); } With these control bits, higher-level instructions like D=D+M or M=!M are implemented simply by choosing the correct input parameter combination.

## Assembler: Hack assembly to machine code
Once the computer chip worked in simulation, I wrote a two-pass assembler in Java for the Hack assembly language. It resolves labels and variables, then emits 16-bit binary instructions.

### Two-pass design
First pass scans labels (for example, (LOOP) ) and records their ROM addresses. Second pass encodes A and C instructions into their binary form.

### Symbol table
Pre-populated with predefined registers (R0-R15), pointers (SP, LCL, ARG), screen and keyboard addresses, then extended with user variables starting at address 16.

### Assembler encoding example

### Input assembly
// Simple loop @i M=1 (LOOP) @i M=M+1 @10 D;JLT @LOOP 0;JMP

### Generated machine code
0000000000010000   // @i (allocated at 16) 1110111111001000   // M=1 0000000000010000   // @i 1111110111011000   // M=M+1 0000000000001010   // @10 1110001100000100   // D;JLT 0000000000000010   // @LOOP (ROM address 2) 1110101010000111   // 0;JMP Running this binary on the hardware simulator shows the register and RAM state changing as expected, proving the assembler and CPU agree on the instruction set.

## VM translator: stack machine to Hack assembly
Part 2 starts the software hierarchy. I implemented a VM translator in Java that converts a high-level stack-based VM language into Hack assembly. This layer decouples Jack from the hardware and introduces function calls and static segments.

### Arithmetic and logic
Commands such as add , sub , eq , lt , and gt pop values from the stack, compute, and push results using small assembly templates.

### Memory segments
Implemented pointer logic for local , argument , this , that , temp , pointer , and static segments.

### Functions and calls
Implemented call frames following the Hack VM spec: save caller state, set ARG and LCL, jump to callee, and restore on return.

### VM to assembly example

### Input VM snippet
function Simple.addTwo 0 push argument 0 push constant 2 add return

### Generated Hack assembly (excerpt)
// function Simple.addTwo 0 (Simple.addTwo) // full generation for "push argument 0" @ARG D=M @0 A=D+A D=M @SP A=M M=D @SP M=M+1 // similar generation for push constant 2 command // similar generation for add command These templates are reused across all Jack programs, making the VM translator a key abstraction boundary between language and hardware.

## Jack compiler: high-level language on custom hardware
The final stage was a full compiler pipeline for the Jack language, written in Java. Jack is a Java-like language with classes, methods, fields, arrays, and basic control flow. The compiler targets the stack VM, which my translator then lowers to Hack assembly.

### Front-end
A tokenizer converts characters into tokens (keywords, identifiers, symbols, integers, strings). A recursive descent parser (CompilationEngine) walks the grammar and emits VM commands while constructing and consulting symbol tables.

### Symbol tables
Separate tables for class-level and subroutine scope track identifiers, their kind (field, static, local, argument), and index. This allows fields of each instance to map cleanly to memory segments.

### Code generation
Control structures such as if/while use generated labels, while expressions and terms emit stack operations that match the VM semantics.

### Example: compiling a Jack method

### Input Jack code
class Counter { field int value; method void inc(int delta) { let value = value + delta; return; }

### Generated VM code
// Declare method inc with 1 local variable function Counter.inc 1 // push this.value push argument 0 // Set pointer 0 -> 'this' pop pointer 0 // Push current this.value push this 0 // Push the increment amount (delta) push argument 1 // Compute this.value + delta add // Store result back into this.value pop this 0 push constant 0 return // Return 0 (dummy return value for void-like method) Running this through the VM translator and assembler produces Hack machine code that manipulates the value field stored in the heap area controlled by the OS memory manager.

### Example: parsing expressions in Java
The recursive descent compiler uses small focused methods that mirror the grammar. For example, expression compilation handles operator precedence and emits VM operations as it walks the parse tree. // Simplified Java-style excerpt private void compileExpression() { compileTerm(); while (tokenIsOneOf("+", "-", "*", "/", "&", "|", "<", ">", "=")) { String op = currentToken(); advance(); compileTerm(); writeArithmetic(op); // maps '+' to 'add', '<' to 'lt', etc. } This design keeps the compiler readable and makes it easy to trace from Jack source through VM and assembly when debugging.

## End-to-end pipeline
With the full pipeline in place, I compiled and ran several Jack applications, including the supplied Tetris, a simple OS API, and my own small programs that manipulate memory, draw graphics, and handle keyboard input.

### End-to-end flow
Jack source (User Input Programming Language) -> Java Compiler -> VM code -> Java VM translator -> Hack assembly -> Java assembler -> 16-bit machine code -> executed on the computer emulated from NAND gates. The Compiler, VM translator and assembler were built from scratch in Java.

### Debugging
Used the hardware and VM simulators to step through instructions, inspect RAM and stack, and validate that higher-level bugs were not caused by lower-level hardware mistakes.

## Impact and learnings

### Systems thinking
Gained a concrete understanding of how compilers, virtual machines, and hardware interact, instead of treating them as black boxes.

### Compiler and language design
Implemented a real compiler front-end and back-end, including lexical analysis, parsing, symbol tables, and code generation for a custom language.

### Hardware intuition
Designing the ALU, CPU, and memory from primitive gates sharpened my intuition for performance, instruction set design, and the cost of different operations.

### Reliability through abstraction
Each layer (HDL chips, assembler, VM, compiler) had a clear contract and test suite, which made debugging manageable despite how much was built from scratch.

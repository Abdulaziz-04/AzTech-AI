# Statistical Analysis of TA Hiring Bias in Computing Programs
Data-driven intersectional study that analyzed more than 15,000 teaching assistant applications across computing courses to uncover gender and demographic disparities in TA hiring and to inform equity focused policy changes.

### Note
WNB refers to Women and Non Binary applicants grouped together for statistical privacy and stability in the study results.

### Publication

### Role
Research Assistant and Analyst

### Timeline
Jan 2024 - May 2024

### Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, statsmodels, Matplotlib, Plotly Relative percentage of all applications by course, split by WNB and Men. Many foundational courses show similar or even higher WNB application rates, which means downstream hiring differences cannot be explained purely by lack of interest or pipeline.

## Quick insights

### Goal
Quantify whether teaching assistant hiring decisions in a large computing program differ by gender, race, and student status, and provide data backed recommendations that departments can turn into policy. Why this matters Very few peer reviewed papers study TA hiring patterns, even though TAs are central to grading, mentoring, and classroom culture. This work adds a crucial but rarely measured dimension to equity work in computing education research.

### Headline result
For entry level MS courses we observed that Women and Non Binary (WNB) applicants were hired at markedly lower rates than Men , despite comparable application patterns. For one cluster of entry level MS courses the effect corresponded to roughly a 42.5% shortfall in WNB hires relative to their share of the qualified applicant pool. What WNB means WNB refers to Women and Non Binary applicants grouped together . The number of non binary applicants was extremely small, which made separate statistical analysis unreliable and at risk of exposing individuals. Following common practice, we merged women and non binary applicants into a single category for robust and privacy preserving analysis.

## Preliminary Analysis
The dataset spanned multiple years of TA applications for both undergraduate and graduate computing courses. Each record included applicant demographics, course applied for, instructor, and hiring outcome. My contribution focused on cleaning the data, building reproducible analysis notebooks, and constructing interactive visualizations that faculty could explore.

### Data preparation
Normalized course names, merged multiple application systems, and filtered to applicants who met minimum eligibility criteria so that we compared candidates who were realistically hireable.

### Statistical tests
Used Jensen Shannon Distance (JSD) , two sample t-tests, and one way ANOVA to compare hiring outcomes across demographic groups and instructors.

### Additional demographic analysis
Beyond gender, we examined patterns by race, by international versus domestic status, and prior teaching experience. We also ran intersectional analyses for race × gender and race × international status to test whether disparities compound for specific groups.

## Course level application patterns
The Relative Percentage of All Applications by Course (chart at the top) compares how often WNB and Men apply to each course. It helps

### answer two key questions
Do WNB candidates apply to the same types of courses as Men Do hiring outcomes reflect these application patterns Several MS level gateway courses have substantial WNB application shares that are similar to or higher than Men. This was important because it ruled out a simple explanation that WNB candidates were not applying to the courses where hiring imbalances appeared.

## MS courses Focus
The MS Course Application Share Chart zooms in on graduate level courses that serve as entry points for MS students. Bars show the percentage of all applications for each course that come from WNB applicants versus Men. Percent of applications by gender for MS level courses. Many courses show healthy WNB representation in the applicant pool, yet these shares are not always reflected in final hires. For several introductory MS courses, WNB applicants make up a significant fraction of the applicant pool. When combined with hiring outcomes, the analysis revealed that WNB candidates were not being hired in proportion to their application rates , especially in entry level TA roles where teaching experience is first acquired.

## Instructor Hiring Divergence and Jensen Shannon Distance
To understand where disparities originate, we needed a way to compare the distribution of genders in the applicant pool with the distribution of genders among hires for each instructor and course. For this we used Jensen Shannon Distance (JSD) . Distribution of Jensen Shannon Distance values for WNB preferred courses, Men preferred courses, and the overall course set. Higher values indicate stronger divergence between applicant and hire distributions for a course or instructor. Why Jensen Shannon Distance JSD measures how different two probability distributions are and is symmetric and bounded between 0 and 1 . A value of 0 means the hiring distribution exactly matches the applicant distribution, and values closer to 1 indicate strong divergence. Unlike raw percentage gaps, JSD lets us aggregate across many courses with different applicant counts and still compare them fairly. It is also stable when some categories have small counts, which made it well suited for our departmental scale data. Using JSD, we could group courses into those where hiring favored WNB applicants, those where hiring favored Men, and those that were roughly aligned with the pool. This grouping was later tested with t-tests and ANOVA to check which differences were statistically significant. The histogram shows that a subset of courses has consistently high JSD values skewed toward Men , indicating that instructors in these courses hire Men at rates that diverge significantly from the applicant pool composition. This provided strong evidence that instructor level decisions, not just pipeline, contribute to the observed disparities.

## Topic Modeling Insights
To understand whether WNB and Men prefer different types of courses, we applied topic modeling to course descriptions and grouped courses into themes. Key takeaways are summarized below. Topic modeling revealed that WNB applicants were more likely to apply to project based, programming intensive, and application focused courses , such as software engineering and design oriented classes. Men were more likely to apply to math heavy and theory oriented courses , including algorithms, machine learning theory, and systems style offerings. These preference differences align with prior work on gendered course choices, but they did not fully explain the hiring gap . Even in courses where WNB formed a large share of the applicant pool, hiring patterns still favored Men in several important MS entry level roles.

## Key Findings and Impact

### Instructor decisions drive much of the disparity
Comparing JSD values and hiring rates showed that the largest imbalances come from instructor level selection, not lack of WNB applicants. Some instructors hired close to the pool distribution, while others showed strong skew toward Men.

### WNB are under selected for entry level MS TA roles
In several graduate gateway courses WNB application rates were high, but hires lagged significantly behind their representation, including an estimated 42.5% shortfall in one entry level TA cluster.

### Intersectional gaps matter
Analyses by race, international status, and their intersections highlighted that some groups, such as international WNB applicants from underrepresented racial backgrounds, experience compounded disadvantages that would be invisible in gender only statistics.

### Policy influence
The results informed equity focused recommendations that were adopted by academic leadership for the 2025 hiring cycle, including structured rubrics, bias training for instructors, and department wide monitoring of demographic distributions in TA hiring.

### Long term contribution
This project demonstrates that TA hiring can and should be treated as a measurable part of equity efforts in computing. The combination of JSD based divergence metrics, traditional hypothesis tests, and interactive dashboards provides a reusable blueprint for other departments to audit their own processes. Overall, the analysis showed that while application patterns and topic preferences differ slightly by gender, the largest disparities come from how instructors convert applicants into hires . This makes TA hiring an essential and previously overlooked dimension of diversity work in computing education.

# Mood Synergizer - Emotion Aware Music Player
Interactive Applications Desktop application that reads a user's facial expression from the webcam, detects their dominant emotion, and instantly launches a curated playlist that matches the mood. Designed as a playful way for students to unwind after work or studying.

### Tech Stack
Python, Tkinter, OpenCV, DeepFace, Pillow, Pygame Main Mood Synergizer window with live camera preview, snapshot button, and detected mood banner. The app keeps the camera view local on device to preserve privacy.

## Quick insights

### Goal
Turn a webcam into a simple "mood remote" that can pick up a user's expression and start music that matches how they feel without extra clicks.

### Approach
Capture a snapshot from the webcam, run DeepFace emotion analysis on device, map the detected mood to a local playlist, and provide a dedicated music player window with full playback controls.

### Outcome
A responsive desktop app that lets users go from neutral desktop to "music that fits my mood" in a single click while keeping all images and predictions on their own machine.

## User experience
Mood Synergizer is designed to feel like a small companion on the side of a workspace. The main window shows a live camera preview, a clear "Take Snapshot & Detect" button, and a mood label that updates once detection finishes. From there, a second window opens for the music player so the user can minimize the camera and just enjoy the playlist. Large, high contrast buttons and labels make it easy to use even while multitasking. The player window surfaces the current mood at the top and shows a simple list of available tracks for that mood. Playback controls include play, pause, stop, next, and previous so users can stay on a mood but still skip individual tracks.

## How it works end to end
Under the hood, the application wires together real time video capture, emotion classification, and a lightweight audio engine.

### Webcam capture
OpenCV streams frames from the default camera into the Tkinter window. A snapshot button freezes the current frame and saves it locally for analysis.

### Emotion detection
DeepFace runs a pre trained emotion model on the snapshot and returns the dominant emotion label such as happy, sad, angry, neutral, or surprised.

### Mood to playlist mapping
Each emotion maps to a specific folder of songs on disk. If a mood has no configured folder, the system falls back to a peaceful playlist so the user always gets a calming result instead of an error. Current mood categories are "Happy", "Sad", "Angry", "Peaceful"

### Music playback
pygame.mixer loads all supported audio files in that folder, starts playing the first track automatically, and exposes controls to move forward or backward through the list while updating status text such as "Now playing".

## Mood player interface
Example "sad" mood playlist with matching ambient tracks. Each mood gets its own curated list of songs and full playback controls.

## Robustness and safety
Since this is a camera based application, error handling and privacy were important parts of the implementation. The app defends against missing cameras or driver issues by showing status messages and disabling detection until a stream is available. If a mood folder has no songs, it gracefully drops into a peaceful playlist rather than failing. This keeps the experience positive even when configuration is incomplete. All snapshots and emotion predictions stay on the local machine. No frames are uploaded to a remote server. On exit, the application stops playback, releases the camera, and closes all windows cleanly to avoid locking audio or camera resources.

## Future directions

### Spotify integration
Extend the mood to playlist mapping to call the Spotify Web API and fetch personalized playlists based on the detected emotion and the user's listening history.

### Richer mood taxonomy
Group similar emotions into broader categories like focus, relax, and energize, then blend playlists across moods.

### Session analytics
Add optional local logs so users can see which moods and playlists they trigger most often and how long they listen.

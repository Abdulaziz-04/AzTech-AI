# Backend Microservices Suite: HTTP Utilities, Files, Time, and URLs
Backend & Distributed Logic

# Backend Microservices Suite
A small but fully working suite of Node.js microservices built for FreeCodeCamp's Backend Development and APIs certification. Each service is independently deployable, exposes a clean JSON API, and is wired into a simple dashboard for local testing. I completed all backend projects and submitted these four services (request header parser, file metadata service, timestamp API, and URL shortener) as the final assignments, earning the Backend Development and APIs certification .

### Tech Stack
Node.js, Express, MongoDB (NoSQL), middleware-based routing, CORS Local microservices dashboard. Each card launches the original UI and lets me test the underlying REST endpoint from a single place.

## Quick insights

### Goal
Build a set of focused microservices that demonstrate HTTP parsing, file handling, time conversion, and persistent URL shortening while following RESTful design and good error handling practices.

### Scope

### Four services running on separate ports behind a simple dashboard
Browser-IP "whoami" service, timestamp converter, file metadata analyzer, and a MongoDB-backed URL shortener.

### Outcome
Delivered a clean, testable backend playground that can be containerized and deployed as independent services or as part of a larger API-gateway architecture.

## Service overview
All four microservices are simple by design, but together they cover a lot of backend fundamentals: parsing HTTP headers, validating user input, translating between representations, handling file uploads, and persisting entities with a database.

### Browser-IP microservice (whoami)
Returns a JSON snapshot of the client's IP address, preferred language, and user-agent. Useful for debugging clients or building personalization layers.

### Timestamp microservice
Accepts date strings or Unix timestamps, normalizes them, and returns both Unix and UTC representations, including for "now" when no parameter is given.

### File metadata microservice
Receives uploads via multipart/form-data, inspects the file, and returns its name, MIME type, and size. Runs entirely in memory, no files are persisted to disk.

### URL shortener
Validates and stores long URLs in MongoDB, generates a compact token, and redirects short URLs back to the original destination.

## Sample responses
Browser-IP service returning IP, language, and user-agent string. Timestamp service converting 2015-12-25 to Unix and UTC formats. File metadata service summarizing an uploaded PDF resume. URL shortener service mapping a long FreeCodeCamp URL to a short token.

## Architecture and Design Choices
I intentionally structured these as independent Express apps to mimic a microservices setup instead of one monolith with many routes. Each service has its own port, middleware stack, and health checks, which makes it straightforward to containerize and scale them separately.

### Express-first design
Each service uses Express with a thin index file that wires up middleware, route handlers, and error handling. I use environment variables for ports and MongoDB URIs so the suite can run locally or on a cloud host without code changes.

### Shared patterns
Even though the services are separate, they share patterns such as centralized validation, consistent JSON error structures, and clearly documented endpoints that mirror the FreeCodeCamp spec.

## Edge cases and Robustness
To go beyond the bare minimum for the certification, I spent time thinking through failure modes and how APIs should behave when users supply odd inputs.

### Timestamp parsing
When the date parameter is missing, the service returns the current time. If the input is ambiguous, it tries Unix and ISO-8601 parsing, then returns a helpful JSON error instead of a 500. This mirrors how production APIs often have to be forgiving but explicit.

### File uploads
The metadata service checks for missing files, unsupported content types, and empty payloads, and responds with a clear validation message. Uploads are limited in size and never written to disk, making it safe to run in memory-constrained environments.

### URL validation
The shortener normalizes URLs, rejects malformed domains, and protects against non-http/https schemes. Duplicate URLs reuse the same mapping instead of creating multiple documents, which keeps the database small and predictable.

### Whoami service
If the IP header is missing or proxied, the service gracefully falls back to the connection's remote address. It returns language and user-agent exactly as seen, which helps debug issues without mutating data.

## Scaling and Future Enhancements
These projects started as learning exercises, but the design makes it easy to evolve them into production-ready components.

### Containerization and orchestration
Each service can be packaged as a small Docker image and deployed behind an API gateway such as Nginx or an ingress controller in Kubernetes. Horizontal scaling then becomes a matter of increasing replica counts per service.

### Persistent analytics
The whoami and timestamp services could log anonymized usage stats to a time-series store (for example, Prometheus or a simple Postgres table) to visualize traffic patterns and client platforms.

### Hardened URL shortener
Adding rate limiting, per-user quotas, and link expiration would turn the shortener into a more realistic service. A background job could clean up expired links while preserving click statistics.

### File gateway
The metadata service could be extended to temporarily store files in S3 or another object store and act as a front door for larger upload workflows, while still returning immediate metadata to the client.

## Impact and learnings

### Microservice mindset
Even though these services are small, building and running four separate backends taught me how to think about boundaries, observability, and independent deployments.

### API ergonomics
Designing simple, predictable JSON responses and handling weird user input gracefully is something I now carry into my larger backend work.

### Production readiness
Experimenting with validation, error messages, and database interactions here gave me a small sandbox to practice habits that scale to more complex microservice architectures.

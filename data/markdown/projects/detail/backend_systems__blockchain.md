# BitHeat - Blockchain Built From Scratch in Node.js
Backend & Distributed Logic A full peer-to-peer blockchain system implemented from scratch in Node.js. Includes Proof-of-Work mining, dynamic difficulty, a wallet with ECDSA signatures, a transaction pool, block validation, and a WebSocket-based P2P network for chain replication.

### Tech Stack
Node.js, WebSockets, SHA-256 hashing, ECDSA (elliptic), crypto utilities High-level architecture: wallet -> transaction pool -> miner -> block creation -> P2P broadcast -> chain sync.

## Quick insights

### Goal
Understand blockchain fundamentals by re-creating the full system i.e. ledger, consensus, networking, wallets, and mining-from first principles.

### Scope
Implemented Proof-of-Work, dynamic difficulty, transaction signing, mempool validation, longest-chain rule, peer discovery, and full chain synchronization.

### Outcome
A locally distributed blockchain where multiple nodes mine, broadcast, and converge on the same chain using deterministic validation rules.

## System overview
BitHeat is composed of four major components working together to maintain a consistent decentralized ledger. Each node exposes an HTTP API for wallets and a WebSocket P2P layer for block propagation.

### 1. Blockchain
Each block stores timestamp, last hash, hash, transaction list, nonce, and difficulty. Block validation ensures correct linkage, hash correctness, and Proof-of-Work compliance. Chain validation ensures the entire history is valid before accepting any peer chain.

### 2. Wallet & Transactions
Wallet generates ECDSA public/private key pairs using elliptic curve cryptography. Transactions are signed using the private key and verified on every node. TransactionPool keeps only valid, non-conflicting transactions.

### 3. Mining
Miner gathers valid transactions from the pool. Runs Proof-of-Work: increment nonce until hash has required leading zeros. Difficulty adjusts up/down based on time it took to mine the last block.

### 4. Peer-to-Peer Network
Nodes communicate through WebSockets using p2p-server.js. Newly mined blocks broadcast to all peers. Nodes automatically replace their chain if a longer valid chain is received.

## Block mining code snippet
//Basic attributes constructor(timestamp, last_hash, hash, data, nonce, difficulty) { this.timestamp = timestamp this.last_hash = last_hash this.hash = hash this.data = data //Random number for hashing problems this.nonce = nonce //Setting up difficulty to adjust mining time this.difficulty = typeof difficulty === 'number' difficulty : DIFFICULTY } Block structure: header references, payload, nonce, and difficulty. //Building new blocks with hashes of previous block static mineBlock(last_block, data) { let timestamp, hash let { difficulty } = last_block let nonce = 0 const last_hash = last_block.hash //Rehash until the leading-zero difficulty target is met do { nonce++ timestamp = Date.now() difficulty = Block.adjustDifficulty(last_block, timestamp) hash = Block.hash(timestamp, last_hash, data, nonce, difficulty) } while (hash.substring(0, difficulty) !== '0'.repeat(difficulty)) return new Block(timestamp, last_hash, hash, data, nonce, difficulty) } //performing the hash static hash(timestamp, last_hash, data, nonce, difficulty) { return util.hash(`${timestamp}${last_hash}${JSON.stringify(data)}${nonce}${difficulty}`) } Mining flow: iterate nonce, adjust difficulty, and hash until the target is satisfied.

## Helpful Visualizations
Transaction pool lifecycle and validation flow.

## Why it matters
Implementing a blockchain from scratch provides hands-on experience in decentralized system design, distributed consensus, validation logic, and cryptographic integrity. It is a practical demonstration of how modern blockchains maintain trust without a central authority.

### Consensus understanding
Proof-of-Work, difficulty retargeting, fork resolution.

### Distributed systems
WebSocket messaging, chain replication, and peer sync rules.

### Security concepts
Digital signatures, transaction integrity, deterministic validation.

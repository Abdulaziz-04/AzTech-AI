# FlashChat - Student chat application for Campus
Cross-platform mobile app built with Flutter and Firebase for students to swap quick updates, ask questions, and hang out in topic-based rooms, without the clutter of public social media.

### Tech Stack
Flutter SDK, Dart, Firebase Core, Cloud Firestore, Cross-platform Secure login screen with subtle background visuals. Conversation view highlighting quick replies and friendly avatars.

## Quick insights

### Goal
A 2-week quick sprint to give university students a lightweight place to chat in focused rooms, share campus updates, and ask questions without needing to trade phone numbers or social media handles.

### Approach
Built a real-time group messaging app using Flutter and Firebase where users register and login with email and join pre-defined rooms like Campus Updates, Career Discussion, Unpopular Opinions and Programming Help.

### Result
Delivered a responsive Android app with real-time Firestore-backed chat, handling multiple clients, consistent performance across devices, and a UI simple enough for first-time smartphone users.

## System overview
FlashChat is structured as a thin Flutter front end on top of Firebase backend services. All messaging is live, with Firestore handling persistence and real-time streams, which keeps the client code small and focused on UI and state management.

### Authentication and privacy
Uses Firebase Authentication email and password sign in. Only the user email is stored as an identifier in chat messages, which keeps the profile surface minimal while still allowing basic identity in rooms.

### Real-time messaging
Messages are added to a room collection in Cloud Firestore and streamed back to all subscribed clients using real-time listeners. This keeps chats synchronized across devices without manual polling.

### Room model
Each chat room is a Firestore document with its own messages subcollection. Rooms are currently curated to keep content focused. Students can quickly hop between rooms.

### Client deployment
The Flutter app is compiled to an Android APK and uploaded to google drive, so that testers and classmates can download and install builds during development.

## Student-centered features

### Topic rooms for campus life
Separate rooms for programming help, physics questions, career advice, sci-fi discussions, and general hangouts. This reduces noise and lets students pick the social context they want.

### Simple, friendly UI
Chat bubbles, clear timestamps, and large buttons make the app approachable. Animations and subtle colors highlight which messages are yours versus others.

### Real-time delivery
Messages appear instantly across clients using Firestore streams, creating the feel of a live group chat rather than delayed forum posts.

### Low-friction onboarding
New users only need an email and password to start chatting. There is no complex profile form or friend-request flow to get in the way.

### Lightweight and portable
The app is small enough to install quickly and runs smoothly on lower-end Android devices and on iOS platforms as well, which was important for a mixed hardware student population.

## Screen tour
Registration flow for new students. List of chat rooms for different topics like career, physics, and casual chats. Career Discussions room - students ask about future prospects in computer science.

## Development process
The project was scoped as a two week build, split into learning, implementation, and testing phases.

### Days 1 - 4
Learned Dart, the Flutter widget model, and the project file structure. Set up the Flutter SDK, Android tooling, and Firebase project.

### Days 5 - 8
Built the initial UI, wired up navigation between login, room list, and chat screens, and connected Firebase Authentication plus Cloud Firestore reads and writes.

### Days 9 - 14
Tested on multiple screen sizes and phones, improved performance, refined animations, and adjusted layouts so that chat bubbles and input fields behave correctly on different devices.

## Impact and learnings

### Real-time mobile experience
Built a production-style real-time chat using Firebase Firestore listeners, which later informed how I structure data and indexes for other mobile projects.

### Student community focus
Learned how topic-based rooms and a simple, low-friction UI can encourage more shy students to participate and ask questions that might not show up on public social media.

### Future improvements
Planned enhancements include one-to-one DMs, media sharing, custom room creation, usernames instead of raw emails and stronger end-to-end privacy controls.

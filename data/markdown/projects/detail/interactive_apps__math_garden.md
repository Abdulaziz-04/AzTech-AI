# Math Garden - Handwritten digits and growing garden feedback
Interactive Applications

# Math Garden - Interactive Toddler App
A browser-based addition game for toddlers and early learners where they write the answer by hand, a small MLP neural network recognizes the digit in real time, and a colorful garden grows or shrinks based on their answers.

### Tech Stack
Python, TensorFlow, MLP neural network,TensorFlow.js, JavaScript, HTML /CSS Math Garden's main screen: kids solve tiny addition problems and draw the answer in the black square to help the garden flourish.

## Quick insights

### Goal
Turn early math practice into a playful, low-pressure activity where toddlers feel like they are nurturing a garden instead of taking a test.

### Gameplay loop
The page shows random addition problems, Children write the answer using a finger, stylus, or mouse on a canvas and tap "Check Answer" to see if the garden grows.

### ML in the browser
A pre-trained 3-layer dense MNIST classifier is converted to a TensorFlow.js model and runs entirely in the browser. OpenCV.js preprocesses the canvas and the MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) neural network predicts the digit with no backend calls.

### Feedback
Correct answers stack new SVG background layers and grow the garden through six stages. Mistakes gently shrink one step, keeping feedback clear but not discouraging for young kids.

## Experience and game flow
The interface is intentionally minimal so pre-readers can play with almost no instructions from adults.

### Single page play
The entire game lives on one HTML page with no menus. A new addition problem appears immediately after each attempt to keep the rhythm simple and predictable for toddlers.

### Handwriting canvas
An HTML5 canvas captures strokes from both mouse and touch events. Kids literally "write" the answer inside the black tile, which feels more like drawing than typing numbers.

### Garden growth mechanic
Each correct answer increments a score and swaps in the next SVG background to represent a fuller garden. After six correct answers the garden is "fully blossomed" and the scene resets for another short session.

### Gentle mistakes
An incorrect prediction shrinks the garden by one layer instead of resetting everything, encouraging experimentation without harsh penalties. Gameplay snippet: the child writes the answer, the MLP recognizes the digit, and the garden grows as a visual reward.

## Architecture at a glance
Math Garden is designed as a self contained browser experience with a Python based training pipeline that lives alongside the front end code.

### Front end
Vanilla JavaScript manages state and math problem generation. An HTML5 canvas captures strokes along with CSS styling.

### Processing pipeline
When "Check Answer" is pressed, OpenCV.js converts the canvas to grayscale, thresholds, finds the main contour, crops, resizes, pads to 28×28, recenters the digit, and normalizes pixel values before turning it into a tensor.

### On device inference
TensorFlow.js loads the model and runs a single forward pass of the MLP to predict the digit. Everything runs locally in the browser, so the game works offline once assets are cached.

### No backend dependency
There is no live server side API in the gameplay loop. Python scripts exist only for offline training and evaluation.

## MLP model and training pipeline
The core of the game is a simple but effective multilayer perceptron trained on handwritten digits. It is light enough to run in real time in JavaScript while still robust to kids' messy handwriting.

### Model architecture
A 3 layer dense network built in TensorFlow with ReLU activations and a 10 way softmax output for digits 0-9.

### Training
A Python script trains a handwritten-digit-classifier on MNIST, logs to TensorBoard, and exports a model once validation accuracy converges which is saved for quick inference.

### JS conversion
The saved model is loaded using TensorFlow.js so that the front end can load the model directly in the browser.

## Impact and Learnings

### Kid friendly ML demo
The project doubles as a playful toddler math game and a concrete example of how on device ML can be used in education with no setup beyond opening a web page.

### End to end pipeline experience
Implementing both the Python training scripts and the TensorFlow.js inference path reinforced best practices for exporting, converting, and validating models across environments.

### Browser UX for toddlers
Handling both mouse and touch events, preventing accidental scrolls, and keeping the UI minimal were key to making the experience work for very young users.

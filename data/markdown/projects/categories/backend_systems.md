# Backend, Systems & Distributed Logic

### Full-Stack Search Engine: Crawl, Index, Rank, and Rerank

### Built an end-to-end search engine over a nuclear-safety corpus
custom crawler, compressed inverted indexes, classic IR ranking (TF-IDF/BM25/LM), graph algorithms (PageRank/HITS), vertical search UI with manual assessments, learning-to-rank, and ML-powered spam filtering.

### Tech Stack
Python, Flask, ElasticSearch, NumPy, scikit-learn, pandas, BeautifulSoup, multi-threading, custom inverted index storage

### From Nand to Tetris: Building a Compiler from Scratch
Two-part systems project where I built a full 16-bit computer, assembler, virtual machine, and compiler from primitive NAND gates. The stack ends in a high-level programming language called Jack that runs on the hardware I designed using an emulator.

### Tech Stack
Hardware Description Language (HDL), Hack assembly, Java , shell tooling, hardware and VM emulators

### BitHeat - Blockchain Built From Scratch in Node.js
A full peer-to-peer blockchain system implemented from scratch in Node.js. Includes Proof-of-Work mining, dynamic difficulty, a wallet with ECDSA signatures, a transaction pool, block validation, and a WebSocket-based P2P network for chain replication.

### Tech Stack
Node.js, WebSockets, SHA-256 hashing, ECDSA (elliptic), crypto utilities

### Backend Microservices Suite
A small but fully working suite of Node.js microservices built for FreeCodeCamp's Backend Development and APIs certification. Each service is independently deployable, exposes a clean JSON API, and is wired into a simple dashboard for local testing.

### Tech Stack
Node.js, Express, MongoDB (NoSQL), middleware-based routing, CORS

### Price Notifier with WhatsApp Alerts
Lightweight FastAPI service that checks live Amazon prices on demand and every 6 hours, then sends WhatsApp alerts via Twilio when a price is within the target price range. Simple browser UI, optional send delay, Docker deploy, and multi-URL tracking via CSV for personal use.

### Tech Stack
FastAPI, asyncio, BeautifulSoup, Twilio API, uvicorn, React, Docker, Heroku
